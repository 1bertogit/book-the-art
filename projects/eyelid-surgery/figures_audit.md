# Figure Audit — The Art of Eyelid Surgery

This audit evaluates the 27 registered figures based on existence, quality, and scientific coherence.

## Executive Summary
- **Total Registered**: 27
- **Categorization**:
  - `final-ok`: 0
  - `draft`: 0
  - `ai-draft`: 27
  - `missing`: 0

> [!WARNING]
> All current figures are classified as **ai-draft**. While they exist as files, they contain significant typographic errors (e.g., "ANTERIOT", "RETAING") and anatomical inaccuracies that are not suitable for a premium medical publication.

## Audit Table

| Figure ID | Filename | Status | Observations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FIG-01-01 | FIG-01-01_filosofia-rejuvenescimento.png | `ai-draft` | Conceptual AI draft with gibberish text. |
| FIG-02-01 | FIG-02-01_luz-sombra-periorbitario.png | `ai-draft` | AI-generated anatomical diagram with typos. |
| FIG-03-01 | FIG-03-01_envelhecimento-multifatorial.png | `ai-draft` | AI-generated anatomical diagram with typos. |
| FIG-04-01 | FIG-04-01_lamelas-septo-ligamentos.png | `ai-draft` | **Critical Anatomy**: Major typos ("ANTERIOT", "RETAING"). |
| FIG-05-01 | FIG-05-01_mapa-risco-zonas.png | `ai-draft` | **Critical Safety**: Typos and misplaced anatomical labels. |
| FIG-07-01 | FIG-07-01_fotodoc... | `ai-draft` | AI-generated protocol draft. |
| FIG-08-01 | FIG-08-01_vetores... | `ai-draft` | AI-generated draft. |
| ... | ... | `ai-draft` | All other figures (FIG-09 to FIG-28) share similar AI artifacts. |

## Scientific Coherence Check
- **Result**: **FAILED**. 
- **Reasoning**: The text in chapters refers to specific anatomical structures (e.g., LOM, ORL) which are either missing or incorrectly labeled in the AI drafts. Using these in a client evaluation would be risky.

## Next Steps
1. Keep the figure files as placeholders for layout testing only.
2. **Do NOT remove "FIGURA NECESSÁRIA" markers** yet, as the current images do NOT fulfill the scientific requirements.
3. Plan for professional medical illustration or high-quality photo replacement.
